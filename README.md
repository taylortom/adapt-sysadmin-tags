# adapt-sysadmin-tags

This is an Adapt **authoring tool plugin** which allows Super Admin users to edit and remove tags.

Note that this is a child plugin of the [adapt-sysadmin](https://github.com/taylortom/adapt-sysadmin/) plugin, and as such, will not work without it.

## Installation

1. Copy the contents of `src` `/frontend/src/plugins/sysadmin-tags` in your authoring tool folder.
2. Thatâ€™s it!
